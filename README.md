# Pathfinders
Qompass Intern program: Destitutus ventis, remos adhibe

## What does a Qompass PathFinder do?

- Qompass Pathfinders build cloud-native generative AI services for hybrid deployment in the cloud and on device in alignment with regulatory guidelines from the White House community. 

- Through our program, Pathfinders not only develop the skills for implementing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI uses outside of ChatGPT, but also prepare themselves as the future strategic leaders increasingly called for by the international community at large. Pathfinders build all software using our on-device implementation of post-quantum encryption protocols endorsed by the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) as well as SOTA open-source AI models from industry leaders (Google/Meta/Microsoft) and Huggingface.

## Do I need to know how to code to be a PathFinder?

- No. Character & Curiosity outweighs any coding ability.

##  Am I working for the government?

- No, you're not working for the government. Our Founder is a former Military Intelligence Officer with unique insight into the evolving landscape of AI regulation. Unlike our competitors, we operate in alignment with regulation from the beginning of any of our products or services.

## What is NIST?
- NIST is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. They build guidelines, standards development, and collaboration with industry that shapes the security, quality, and functionality of all consumer electronic products in the United States.
